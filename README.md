# 🌾 AgriChain – Transparent Agri Supply Chain Management (MERN Stack)

> A full-stack solution connecting farmers, transporters, retailers, and consumers for a traceable, transparent, and efficient agricultural supply chain.

---

## Introduction

In traditional agricultural systems, inefficiencies, lack of traceability, and disconnected stakeholders result in high losses, low trust, and poor data visibility. **AgriChain** aims to solve this by creating a digital platform that links all major players in the supply chain — from **farmers to consumers**.

Built using the **MERN stack**, AgriChain enables seamless crop management, real-time transportation tracking, retailer access to farm products, and consumer confidence through end-to-end traceability.
